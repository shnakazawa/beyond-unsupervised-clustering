#  Beyond Unsupervised Clustering: Dimensionality Reduction and Quantitative Analysis

## Objective

This repository houses a notebook featuring codes showcased in [this article (written in Japanese)](https://zenn.dev/aidemy/articles/f1d3ba3c98b708), titled [**"Beyond Unsupervised Clustering: Dimensionality Reduction and Quantitative Analysis."**](Beyond_Unsupervised_Clustering.ipynb) 

Additionally, it includes a notebook entitled [**"Refining Dimensionality Reduction with DynamicViz for Unbiased Insights"**](Refining_Dimensionality_Reduction_with_DynamicViz_for_Unbiased_Insights.ipynb), which offers a quantitative approach for selecting the most suitable dimensionality reduction technique and fine-tuning its hyperparameters. For Japanese readers, [a related article is available here](https://zenn.dev/aidemy/articles/11f3c0deef923c).

These notebooks are intended to deepen your understanding of unsupervised clustering in conjunction with dimensionality reduction and to spark your creative insights in the field.
